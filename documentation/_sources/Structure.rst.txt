Presentation of the modules
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The three main modules are **xdata**, **operation** and **view**.


The module **xdata** aims at the creation of a container for the N dimensional
data and all the relative information on the dimensions and the data itself.
Here is an example of a Xdata instance and one of it's header:

**view**'s main class is Window. Window creates the canvas (i.e. the window)
on witch to display the data. This canvas is composed of a control zone, where
the user can select the filters to apply, and a display zone, in which the user
can zoom and change the labels' position. Window also possesses a Slicer
instance and a ZoomSlicer instance to apply the correct filters on the Xdata
instance.

The module **operation** contains different types of Filters as well as a
Slicer class and a ZoomSlicer class that will apply a succession of Filters on
the Xdata instance. The result of this operation is what is going to be
displayed on the canvas.

The interactions between the various classes are illustrated by the sequence
diagrams bellow.

**list_display**'s main class is ListDisplay. It is an interface for the user
to select what data is to be displayed. For each filter created from the
control zone of a Window instance, a new List instance appears.

**bank** is used to store previously used Headers and units, to save the user
some time.

**header_edit** allows the initialisation of a Xdata element : the user
specifies the headers' labels and units. It suggests some previously used
labels and units thanks to Bank.

**GUI_tools** is a set of tools for the interface.
